# Fortnite-DoublePump

Back in the day when doublepump was a thing in fortnite and because i was too lazy to learn it i created this script to automate the process of the doublepump, now doublepump is dead i thought i could share this to help fellow programmers learn about modules such as pyautogui and keyboard.

you choose where your pump shotguns are and then choose a keybind, when you click the keybind once the script will fire each shotgun once, if held down the keybind the script will continue shooting untill you release the button.

Usage: python doublepump.py CAPSLOCK 2 3

in the above example i chose the keybind to be the CAPSLOCK (easy to reach) and the location of my pump shotguns are 2 & 3.
